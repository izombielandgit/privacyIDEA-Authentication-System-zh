tools菜单包含一些有用的工具来管理您的令牌。

### 12.3.1. Get Serial by OTP value

通过OTP值获取序列号

Here you can enter an OTP value and have the system identify the token. This can be useful if the printed serial number on the token can not be read anymore or if the hardware token has not serial number printed on it at all.

在这里，您可以输入OTP值，并让系统识别令牌。如果令牌上的打印的序列号无法读取，或者如果硬件令牌根本没有打印序列号，则这可能很有用。

You can choose the

你可以选择

* tokentype(令牌类型)
* whether the token is an assigned token or not(令牌是否被分配)
* and the realm of the token(令牌的域)

to set limits to the token search.

以设置对令牌搜索的限制。

> Warning:
> 
> The system needs to got to all tokens and calculate the next (default) 10 OTP values. Depending on the number of tokens you have in the system this can be very time consuming!
> 
> 警告：
> 
> 系统需要找到所有令牌并计算下（默认）10个OTP值。根据您在系统中的令牌数量，这可能非常耗时！

### 12.3.2. Copy token PIN

Here you can enter a token serial number of the token from which you want to copy the OTP PIN and the serial number of the token to which you want to copy it.

This function is also used in the lost token scenario.

But the help desk can also use it if the administrator enrolls a new token to the user and

1. the user can not set the OTP PIN and
2. the administrator should not set or know the OTP PIN.

Then the administrator can create a second token for the user and copy the OTP PIN (which only the user knows) of the old token to the new, second token.

### 12.3.3. Check Policy

If you have complicated policy settings you can use this dialog to determine if the policies behave as expected. You can enter the scope, the real, action user and client to “simulate” e.g. an authentication request.

The system will tell you if any policy is triggered.

### 12.3.4. Export token information

Here you can export the list of the tokens to a CSV file.

> Note:
> 
> In the resolver you can define additional fields, that are usually not used by privacyIDEA. But you can add those fields to the export. Thus you can e.g. add special LDAP attributes in the list of the exported tokens.

### 12.3.5. Export audit information

Here you can export the audit information.

> Warning:
> 
> You should limit the export to a number of audit entries. As the audit log can grow very big, the export of 20.000 audit lines could result in blocking the system.
