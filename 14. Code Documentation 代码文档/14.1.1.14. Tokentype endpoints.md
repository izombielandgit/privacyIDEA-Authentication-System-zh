#### 14.1.1.14. Tokentype endpoints

This API endpoint is a generic endpoint that can be used by any token type.

The tokentype needs to implement a classmethod api_endpoint and can then be called by /ttype/<tokentype>. This way, each tokentype can create its own API without the need to change the core API.

The TiQR Token uses this API to implement its special functionalities. See TiQR Token.

**POST /ttype/(ttype)**

This is a special token function. Each token type can define an additional API call, that does not need authentication on the REST API level.
