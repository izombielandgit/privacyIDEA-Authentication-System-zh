#### 14.1.1.6. Realm endpoints

The realm endpoints are used to define realms. A realm groups together many users. Administrators can manage the tokens of the users in such a realm. Policies and tokens can be assigned to realms.

A realm consists of several resolvers. Thus you can create a realm and gather users from LDAP and flat file source into one realm or you can pick resolvers that collect users from different points from your vast LDAP directory and group these users into a realm.

You will only be able to see and use user object, that are contained in a realm.
