#### 14.1.1.12. Machine endpoints

This REST API is used to list machines from Machine Resolvers.

The code is tested in tests/test_api_machines

**POST /machine/tokenoption**

This sets a Machine Token option or deletes it, if the value is empty.

Parameters:

* hostname – identify the machine by the hostname
* machineid – identify the machine by the machine ID and the resolver name
* resolver – identify the machine by the machine ID and the resolver name
* serial – identify the token by the serial number
* application – the name of the application like “luks” or “ssh”.

Parameters not listed will be treated as additional options.

Return:

**GET /machine/authitem**

This fetches the authentication items for a given application and the given client machine.

Parameters:

* challenge (basestring) – A challenge for which the authentication item is calculated. In case of the Yubikey this can be a challenge that produces a response. The authentication item is the combination of the challenge and the response.
* hostname (basestring) – The hostname of the machine

Return:

* dictionary with lists of authentication items

Example response:

```

**POST /machine/token**

Attach an existing token to a machine with a certain application.

Parameters:

* hostname – identify the machine by the hostname
* machineid – identify the machine by the machine ID and the resolver name
* resolver – identify the machine by the machine ID and the resolver name
* serial – identify the token by the serial number
* application – the name of the application like “luks” or “ssh”.

Parameters not listed will be treated as additional options.

Return:

* json result with “result”: true and the machine list in “value”.

Example request:

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json

{ "hostname": "puckel.example.com",
  "machienid": "12313098",
  "resolver": "machineresolver1",
  "serial": "tok123",
  "application": "luks" }
```

**GET /machine/token**

Return a list of MachineTokens either for a given machine or for a given token.

Parameters:

* serial – Return the MachineTokens for a the given Token
* hostname – Identify the machine by the hostname
* machineid – Identify the machine by the machine ID and the resolver name
* resolver – Identify the machine by the machine ID and the resolver name

Return:

**GET /machine/**

List all machines that can be found in the machine resolvers.

Parameters:

* hostname – only show machines, that match this hostname as substring
* ip – only show machines, that exactly match this IP address
* id – filter for substring matching ids
* resolver – filter for substring matching resolvers
* any – filter for a substring either matching in “hostname”, “ip” or “id”

Return:

* json result with “result”: true and the machine list in “value”.

Example request:

```
GET /hostname?hostname=on HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
