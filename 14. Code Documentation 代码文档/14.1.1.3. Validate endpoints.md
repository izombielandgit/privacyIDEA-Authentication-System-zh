#### 14.1.1.3. Validate endpoints

This module contains the REST API for doing authentication. The methods are tested in the file tests/test_api_validate.py

Authentication is either done by providing a username and a password or a serial number and a password.

**Authentication workflow**

Authentication workflow is like this:

In case of authenticating a user:

* privacyidea.lib.token.check_user_pass()
* privacyidea.lib.token.check_token_list()
* privacyidea.lib.tokenclass.TokenClass.authenticate()
* privacyidea.lib.tokenclass.TokenClass.check_pin()
* privacyidea.lib.tokenclass.TokenClass.check_otp()

In case if authenitcating a serial number:

* privacyidea.lib.token.check_serial_pass()
* privacyidea.lib.token.check_token_list()
* privacyidea.lib.tokenclass.TokenClass.authenticate()
* privacyidea.lib.tokenclass.TokenClass.check_pin()
* privacyidea.lib.tokenclass.TokenClass.check_otp()

**GET /validate/samlcheck**

Authenticate the user and return the SAML user information.

Parameters:

* user – The loginname/username of the user, who tries to authenticate.
* realm – The realm of the user, who tries to authenticate. If the realm is omitted, the user is looked up in the default realm.
* pass – The password, that consists of the OTP PIN and the OTP value.

Return:

* a json result with a boolean “result”: true

Example response for a successful authentication:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

 {
   "detail": {
     "message": "matching 1 tokens",
     "serial": "PISP0000AB00",
     "type": "spass"
   },
   "id": 1,
   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
   "result": {
     "status": true,
     "value": {"attributes": {
                 "username": "koelbel",
                 "realm": "themis",
                 "mobile": null,
                 "phone": null,
                 "myOwn": "/data/file/home/koelbel",
                 "resolver": "themis",
                 "surname": "Kölbel",
                 "givenname": "Cornelius",
                 "email": null},
               "auth": true}
   },
   "version": "privacyIDEA unknown"
 }
```

The response in value->attributes can contain additional attributes (like “myOwn”) which you can define in the LDAP resolver in the attribute mapping.

**POST /validate/samlcheck**

Authenticate the user and return the SAML user information.

Parameters:

* user – The loginname/username of the user, who tries to authenticate.
* realm – The realm of the user, who tries to authenticate. If the realm is omitted, the user is looked up in the default realm.
* pass – The password, that consists of the OTP PIN and the OTP value.

Return:

* a json result with a boolean “result”: true

Example response for a successful authentication:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

 {
   "detail": {
     "message": "matching 1 tokens",
     "serial": "PISP0000AB00",

                 "myOwn": "/data/file/home/koelbel",
                 "resolver": "themis",
                 "surname": "Kölbel",

               "auth": true}
   },
   "version": "privacyIDEA unknown"
 }

**GET /validate/check**

check the authentication for a user or a serial number. Either a serial or a user is required to authenticate. The PIN and OTP value is sent in the parameter pass. In case of successful authentication it returns result->value: true.

Parameters:

* serial – The serial number of the token, that tries to authenticate.
* user – The loginname/username of the user, who tries to authenticate.
* realm – The realm of the user, who tries to authenticate. If the realm is omitted, the user is looked up in the default realm.
* pass – The password, that consists of the OTP PIN and the OTP value.
* otponly – If set to 1, only the OTP value is verified. This is used in the management UI. Only used with the parameter serial.
* transaction_id – The transaction ID for a response to a challenge request
* state – The state ID for a response to a challenge request

Return:

* a json result with a boolean “result”: true
