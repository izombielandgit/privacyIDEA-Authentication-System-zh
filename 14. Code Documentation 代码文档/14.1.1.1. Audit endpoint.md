#### 14.1.1.1. Audit endpoint

This REST API is used to authenticate the users. A user needs to authenticate when he wants to use the API for administrative tasks like enrolling a token.

This API must not be confused with the validate API, which is used to check, if a OTP value is valid. See Validate endpoints.

Authentication of users and admins is tested in tests/test_api_roles.py

You need to authenticate for all administrative tasks. If you are not authenticated, the API returns a 401 response.

To authenticate you need to send a POST request to /auth containing username and password.
