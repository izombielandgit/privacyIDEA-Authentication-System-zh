privacyIDEA provides a security module that takes care of

* encrypting the token seeds,
* encrypting passwords from the configuration like the LDAP password,
* creating random numbers,
* and hashing values.

> Note:
> 
> The Security Module concept can also be used to add a Hardware Security Module to perform the above mentioned tasks.

### 2.10.1. Default Security Module

The default security module is implemented with the operating systems capabilities. The encryption key is located in a file enckey specified via PI_ENCFILE in the configuration file (The Config File).

This enckey contains three 32byte keys and is thus 96 bytes. This file has to be protected. So the access rights to this file are set accordingly.

In addition you can encrypt this encryption key with an additional password. In this case, you need to enter the password each time the privacyIDEA server is restarted and the password for decrypting the enckey is kept in memory.

The pi-manage Script contains the instruction how to encrypt the enckey

After starting the server, you can check, if the encryption key is accessible. To do so run:

```
privacyidea -U <yourserver> --admin=<youradmin> securitymodule
```

The output will contain "is_ready": True to signal that the encryption key is operational.

If it is not yet operational, you need to pass the password to the privacyIDEA server to decrypt the encryption key. To do so run:

```
privacyidea -U <yourserver> --admin=<youradmin> securitymodule  \
--module=default
```

> Note:
> 
> If the security module is not operational yet, you might get an error message “HSM not ready.”.

### 2.10.2. PKCS11 Security Module

The PKCS11 Security Module can be used to encrypt data with an hardware security module, that is connected via the PKCS11 interface. To encrypt and decrypt data you can use an RSA key pair that is stored on the HSM.

To activate this module add the following to the configuration file (The Config File)

PI_HSM_MODULE = “privacyidea.lib.security.pkcs11.PKCS11SecurityModule”
Additional attributes are

PI_HSM_MODULE_MODULE which takes the pkcs11 library. This is the full specified path to the shared object file in the file system.

PI_HSM_MODULE_KEY_ID is the key id (integer) on the HSM.
