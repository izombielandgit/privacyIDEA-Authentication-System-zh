## 2.9. The pi-manage Script|pi-manage脚本

pi-manage is the script that is used during the installation process to setup the database and do many other tasks.

> Note:
> 
> The interesting thing about pi-manage is, that it does not need the server to run as it acts directly on the database. Therefor you need read access to /etc/privacyidea/pi.cfg and the encryption key.

If you want to use a config file other than /etc/privacyidea/pi.cfg, you can set an environment variable:

```
PRIVACYIDEA_CONFIGFILE=/home/user/pi.cfg pi-manage
```

pi-manage always takes a command and sometimes a sub command:

```
pi-manage <command> [<subcommand>] [<parameters>]
```

For a complete list of commands and sub commands use the -h parameter.

You can do the following tasks.

### 2.9.1. Encryption Key

You can create an encryption key and encrypt the encryption key.

Create encryption key:

```
pi-manage create_enckey
```

> Note:
> 
> This command takes no parameters. The filename of the encryption key is read from the configuration. The key will not be created, if it already exists.

The encryption key is a plain file on your hard drive. You need to take care, to set the correct access rights.

You can also encrypt the encryption key with a passphrase. To do this do:

```
pi-manage encrypt_enckey /etc/privacyidea/enckey
```

and pipe the encrypted enckey to a new file.

Read more about the database encryption and the enckey in Security Modules.

### 2.9.2. Backup and Restore

You can create a backup which will be save to /var/lib/privacyidea/backup/.

The backup will contain the database dump and the complete directory /etc/privacyidea which also includes the encryption key.

> Warning:
> 
> As the backup includes the database dump and the encryption key all seeds of the OTP tokens can be read from the backup.

As the backup contains the etc directory and the database you only need this tar archive backup to perform a complete restore.

### 2.9.3. Rotate Audit Log

Audit logs are written to the database. You can use pi-manage to perform a log rotation.

```
pi-manage rotate_audit
```

You can specify a highwatermark and a lowwatermark.
