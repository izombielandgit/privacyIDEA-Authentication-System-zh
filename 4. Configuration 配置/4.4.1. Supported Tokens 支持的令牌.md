If in doubt drop your question on the mailing list.

privacyIDEA支持不同硬件供应商提供的各种令牌。它还支持智能手机上的令牌应用程序。没有列出的令牌也有可能是支持的，因为大多数令牌都使用标准算法。

#### 4.4.1.1. Hardware Tokens

The following hardware tokens are known to work well.

**Yubikey**. The Yubikey is supported in all modes: AES (Yubikey), HOTP and Yubico Cloud. You can initialize the Yubikey yourself, so that the secret key is not known to the vendor.

**eToken Pass**. The eToken Pass is a push button token by SafeNet. It can be initialized with a special hardware device. Or you get a seed file, that you need to import to privacyIDEA. The eToken Pass can run as HOTP or TOTP token.

**eToken NG OTP**. The eToken NG OTP is a push button token by SafeNet. As it has a USB connector, you can initialize the token via the USB connector. Thus the hardware vendor does not know the secret key.

**DaPlug**. The DaPlug token is similar to the Yubikey and can be initialized via the USB connector. The secret key is not known to the hardware vendor.

**Smartdisplayer OTP Card**. This is a push button card. It features an eInk display, that can be read very good in all light condition at all angles. The Smartdisplayer OTP card is initialized at the factory and you get a seed file, that you need to import to privacyIDEA.

**Feitian**. The C100 and C200 tokens are classical, reasonably priced push button tokens. The C100 is an HOTP token and the C200 a TOTP token. These tokens are initialized at the factory and you get a seed file, that you need to import to privacyIDEA.

**U2F**. The Yubikey and the Daplug token are known U2F devices to work well with privacyIDEA. See U2F.

#### 4.4.1.2. Smartphone Apps

**Google Authenticator**. The Google Authenticator is working well in HOTP and TOTP mode. If you choose “Generate OTP Key on the Server” durcing enrollment, you can scan a QR Code with the Google Authenticator. See Enrolling your first token to learn how to do this.

**FreeOTP**. privacyIDEA is known to work well with the FreeOTP App. The FreeOTP App is a TOTP token. So if you scan the QR Code of an HOTP token, the OTP will not validate.

**mOTP**. Several mOTP Apps like “Potato”, “Token2” or “DroidOTP” are supported.
