#### 4.4.2.6. Questionnaire Token

The administrator can define a list of questions and also how many answers to the questions a user needs to define.

管理员可以定义问题列表以及用户需要设置的问题答案数量。

During enrollment of such a question type token the user answers at least as many questions as specified with answers only he knows.

在注册这种question类型令牌时，用户至少回答指定数量（只有他知道答案）的问题。

This token is a challenge response token. During authentication the user must give the token PIN and the a random question from the answered question is chosen. The user has to answer with the same answer he defined earlier.

这是一种挑战响应令牌。在认证期间，用户必须给出令牌PIN，并且回答从设置好的问题中随机选取的问题。答案必须与之前设置的答案相同。

> Note:
> 
> If the administrator changes the questions _after_ a token was enrolled, the enrolled token still works with the old questions and answers. I.e. an enrolled token is not affected by changing the questions by the administrator.

> 注：

> 如果在令牌注册后管理员更改问题，则已注册的令牌仍然与旧的问题和答案一起工作。也就是说已注册的令牌不受管理员更改问题的影响。
