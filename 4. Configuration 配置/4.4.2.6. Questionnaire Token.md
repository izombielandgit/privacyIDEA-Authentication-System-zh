#### 4.4.2.6. Questionnaire Token

The administrator can define a list of questions and also how many answers to the questions a user needs to define.

During enrollment of such a question type token the user answers at least as many questions as specified with answers only he knows.

This token is a challenge response token. During authentication the user must give the token PIN and the a random question from the answered question is chosen. The user has to answer with the same answer he defined earlier.

> Note:
> 
> If the administrator changes the questions _after_ a token was enrolled, the enrolled token still works with the old questions and answers. I.e. an enrolled token is not affected by changing the questions by the administrator.
