#### 4.4.3.6. U2F Token Config

##### 4.4.3.6.1. AppId

You need to configure the AppId of the privacyIDEA server. The AppId is define in the FIDO specification <span id="id1">[[1]](#fido)</span>.

您需要配置privacyIDEA服务器的AppId。AppId在FIDO规范中定义的 [[1]](#fido)。

The AppId is the URL of your privacyIDEA and used to find or create the right key pair on the U2F device. The AppId must correspond the the URL that is used to call the privacyIDEA server.

AppId是您privacyIDEA的链接，用于在U2F设备上查找或创建正确的密钥对。AppId必须对应用于调用privacyIDEA服务器的链接。

> Note:
> 
> if you register a U2F device with an AppId https://privacyidea.example.com and try to authenticate at https://10.0.0.1, the U2F authentication will fail.
> 
> Note:
> 
> The AppId must not contain any trailing slashes!
> 
> 注：
> 
> 如果您注册带有AppId https://privacyidea.example.com的U2F设备，并尝试在https://10.0.0.1进行身份验证，则U2F身份验证将失败。
> 
> 注：
> 
> AppId不能包含任何尾部斜线！

##### 4.4.3.6.2. Facets

If specifying the AppId as the FQDN you will only be able to authenticate at the privacyIDEA server itself or at any application in a sub directory on the privacyIDEA server. This is OK, if you are running a SAML IdP on the same server.

But if you also want to use the U2F token with other applications, you need to specify the AppId like this:

https://privacyidea.example.com/pi-url/ttype/u2f

pi-url is the path, if you are running the privacyIDEA instance in a sub folder.

/ttype/u2f is the endpoint that returns a trusted facets list. Trusted facets are other hosts in the domain example.com. You need to define a policy that contains a list of the other hosts (u2f_facets).

For more information on AppId and trusted facets see <span id="id2">[[1]](#fido)</span>.

For further details and for information how to add U2F to your application you can see the code documentation at U2F Token.

##### 4.4.3.6.3. Workflow

You can use a U2F token on privacyIDEA and other hosts in the same Domain. To do so you need to do the following steps:

1. Configure the AppId to reflect your privacyIDEA server:  
https://pi.your-network.com/ttype/u2f  
Add the path /ttype/u2f is crucial. Otherwise privacyIDEA will not return the trusted facets.
2. Define a policy with the list of trusted facets. (see u2f_facets). Add the FQDNs of the hosts to the policy:  
saml.your-network.com otherapp.your-network.com vpn.your-network.com  
> Note:
> 
> The privacyIDEA plugin for simpleSAMLphp supports U2F with privacyIDEA starting with version 2.8.
3. Now register a U2F token on https://pi.your-network.com. Due to the trusted facets you will also be able to use this U2F token on the other hosts.
4.Now got to https://saml.your-network.com and you will be able to authenticate with the very U2F token without any further registering.
