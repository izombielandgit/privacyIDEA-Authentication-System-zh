#### 4.4.2.8. Registration

(See Registration Code)

The registration token can be used to create a registration code for a user. This registration code can be sent via postal mail to the user, so that the user can use this registration code as a second factor to login to a portal.

After a one single use, the registration code is deleted and can not be used a second time.

> Note:
> 
> The registration code can only be enrolled via the API to provide automated smooth workflow to your needs.

For a more detailed insight see the code documentation Registration Code Token.
