Enroll a RADIUS token

**Check the PIN locally**

If checked, the PIN of the token will be checked on the local server. If the PIN matches only the remaining part of the issued password will be sent to the RADIUS server.

**RADIUS Server**

The RADIUS server, to which the authentication request will be forwarded. You can specify the port like my.radius.server:1812.

**RADIUS User**

When forwarding the request to the RADIUS server, the authentication request will be issued for this user. If the user is left empty, the RADIUS request will be sent with the same user.

**RADIUS Secret**

The RADIUS secret for this RADIUS client.

> Note:
> 
> Using the RADIUS token you can design migration scenarios. When migrating from other (proprietary) OTP solutions, you can enroll a RADIUS token for the users. The RADIUS token points to the RADIUS server of the old solution. Thus the user can authenticate against privacyIDEA with the old, proprietary token, till he is enrolled a new token in privacyIDEA. The interesting thing is, that you also get the authentication request with the proprietary token in the audit log of privacyIDEA. This way you can have a scenario, where users are still using old tokens and other users are already using new (privacyIDEA) tokens. You will see all authentication requests in the pricacyIDEA system.
