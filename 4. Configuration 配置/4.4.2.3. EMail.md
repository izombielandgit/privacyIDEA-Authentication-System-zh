Enroll an EMail token

When enrolling an EMail token, you only need to specify the email address of the user.

The EMail token is a challenge response token. I.e. when using the OTP PIN in the first authentication request, the sending of the EMail will be triggered and in a second authentication request the OTP value from the EMail needs to be presented.

For a more detailed insight see the code documentation Email Token.
