## 4.3. System Config|系统配置

The system configuration has three logical topics: Settings, token default settings and GUI settings.

The system config

### 4.3.1. Settings

#### 4.3.1.1. Split @ Sign

splitAtSign defines if the username like user@company given during authentication should be split into the loginname user and the realm name company. In most cases this is the wanted behaviour.

But given your users log in with email addresses like user@gmail.com and otheruser@outlook.com you probably do not want to split.

#### 4.3.1.2. SAML Attributes

Return SAML attributes defines if during an SAML authentication request additional SAML attributes should be returned. Usually an authentication response only returns true or false.

The SAML attributes are the known attributes that are defined in the attribute mapping e.g. of the LDAP resolver like email, phone, givenname, surname or any other attributes you fetch from the LDAP directory. For more information read LDAP resolver.

In addition you can set the parameter ReturnSamlAttributesOnFail. In this case the response contains the SAML attributes of the user, even if the user failed to authenticate.

#### 4.3.1.3. FailCounterIncOnFalsePin

If during authentication the given PIN matches a token but the OTP value is wrong the failcounter of the tokens for which the PIN matches, is increased. If the given PIN does not match any token, by default no failcounter is increased. The later behaviour can be adapted by FailCounterIncOnFalsePin. If FailCounterIncOnFalsePin is set and the given OTP PIN does not match any token, the failcounter of all tokens is increased.

#### 4.3.1.4. Prepend PIN

PrependPin defines if the OTP PIN should be given in front (“pin123456”) or in the back (“12345pin”) of the OTP value.

#### 4.3.1.5. AutoResync

Auto resync defines if the system should try to resync a token if a user provides a wrong OTP value. AutoResync works like this:

* If the counter of a wrong OTP value is within the resync window, the system remembers the counter of the OTP value for this token in the token info field otp1c.
* Now the user needs to authenticate a second time within auto resync timeout with the next successive OTP value.
* The system checks if the counter of the second OTP value is the successive value to otp1c.
* If it is, the token counter is set and the user is successfully authenticated.

> Note:
> 
> AutoResync works for all HOTP and TOTP based tokens including SMS and Email tokens.

#### 4.3.1.6. Override Authorization Client

Override Authorization client is important with client specific policies (see Policies) and RADIUS servers or other proxies. In case of RADIUS the authenticating client for the privacyIDEA system will always be the RADIUS server, which issues the authentication request. But you can allow the RADIUS server IP to send another client information (in this case the RADIUS client) so that the policy is evaluated for the RADIUS client. Such a proxy or RADIUS server may add the API parameter client with a new IP address.

This field takes a comma separated list of IP Networks mapping to other IP Networks.

Examples

10.1.2.0/24 > 192.168.0.0/16*
Proxies in the sub net 10.1.2.0/24 may mask as client IPs 192.168.0.0/16. In this case the policies for the corresponding client in 192.168.x.x apply.

172.16.0.1

The proxy 172.16.0.1 may mask as any arbitrary client IP.

10.0.0.18 > 10.0.0.0/8

The proxy 10.0.0.18 may mask as any client in the subnet 10.x.x.x.

### 4.3.2. Token default settings

#### 4.3.2.1. Reset Fail Counter

DefaultResetFailCount will reset the failcounter of a token if this token was used for a successful authentication. If not checked, the failcounter will not be resetted and must be resetted manually.


> Note:
> 
> The following settings are token specific value which are set during enrollment. If you want to change this value of a token later on, you need to change this at the tokeninfo dialog.

#### 4.3.2.2. Maximum Fail Counter

DefaultMaxFailCount is the maximum failcounter a token way get. If the failcounter exceeds this number the token can not be used unless the failcounter is resetted.

> Note:
> 
> In fact the failcounter will only increase till this maxfailcount. Even if more failed authentication request occur, the failcounter will not increase anymore.

#### 4.3.2.3. Sync Window

DefaultSyncWindow is the window how many OTP values will be calculated during resync of the token.

#### 4.3.2.4. OTP Length

DefaultOtpLen is the length of the OTP value. If no OTP length is specified during enrollment, this value will be used.

#### 4.3.2.5. Count Window

DefaultCountWindow defines how many OTP values will be calculated during an authentication request.

#### 4.3.2.6. Challenge Validity Time

DefaultChallengeValidityTime is the timeout for a challenge response authentication. If the response is set after the ChallengeValidityTime, the response is not accepted anymore.
