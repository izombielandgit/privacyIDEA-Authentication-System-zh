Enroll a Remote token

**Check the PIN locally**

If checked, the PIN of the token will be checked on the local server. If the PIN matches only the remaining part of the issued password will be sent to the remote privacyIDEA server.

**Remote Server**

The privacyIDEA server, to which the authentication request will be forwarded. The path /validate/check will be added automatically. So a sensible input would be https://my.other.server/.

**Remote Serial**

If the Remote Serial is specified the given password will be checked against the serial number on the remote privacyIDEA server. Usernames will be ignored.

**Remote User**

When forwarding the request to the remote server, the authentication request will be issued for this user.

**Remote Realm**

When forwarding the request to the remote server, the authentication request will be issued for this realm.

**Remote Resolver**

When forwarding the request to the remote server, the authentication request will be issued for this resolver.

> Note:
> 
> You can use Remote Serial to forward the request to a central privacyIDEA server, that only knows tokens but has no knowledge of users. Or you can use Remote Serial to forward the request to an existing to on localhost thus adding a second user to the same token.
