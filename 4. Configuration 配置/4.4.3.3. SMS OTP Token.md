#### 4.4.3.3. SMS OTP Token

The SMS OTP token creates a OTP value and sends this OTP value to the mobile phone of the user. The SMS can be triggered by authenticating with only the OTP PIN:

SMS OTP令牌创建OTP值，并将该OTP值发送给用户的手机。可以通过使用OTP PIN进行验证来触发SMS：

##### 4.4.3.3.1. First step

In the first step the user will enter his OTP PIN and the sending of the SMS is triggered. The user is denied the access.

##### 4.4.3.3.2. Second step

In the second step the user authenticates with the OTP PIN and the OTP value he received via SMS. The user is granted access.

Alternatively the user can authenticate with the transaction_id that was sent to him in the response during the first step and only the OTP value. The transaction_id assures that the user already presented the first factor (OTP PIN) successfully.

A python SMS provider module defines how the SMS is sent. This can be done using an HTTP SMS Gateway. Most services like Clickatel or sendsms.de provide such a simple HTTP gateway. Another possibility is to send SMS via sipgate, which provides an XMLRPC API. The third possibility is to send the SMS via an SMTP gateway. The proovider receives a specially designed email and sends the SMS accordingly. The last possibility to send SMS is to use an attached GSM modem.

In the field SMS provider you can enter the SMS provider module, you wish to use. In the empty field hit the arrow-down key and you will get a list of the ready made modules.

In the SMS configuration text area you can enter the configuration, which contents is very much dependent on the selected provider module.

The HTTP and the Sipgate module provide a preset-button, which give you an idea of the configuration.

##### 4.4.3.3.3. HTTP provider

The HTTP provider can be used for any SMS gateway that provides a simple HTTP POST or GET request.

The following parameters can be used:

**URL**

This is the URL for the gateway.

**HTTP_Method**

Can be GET or POST.

**USERNAME and PASSWORD**

These are the username and the password if the HTTP request requires basic authentication.

**SMS_PHONENUMBER_KEY**

This is the name of the HTTP parameter that holds the mobile phone number of the recipient.

**SMS_TEXT_KEY**

This is the name of the HTTP parameter that holds the SMS text.

**RETURN_SUCCESS**

You can either use RETURN_SUCCESS or RETURN_FAIL. If the text of RETURN_SUCCESS is found in the HTTP response of the gateway privacyIDEA assumes that the SMS was sent successfully.

**RETURN_FAIL**

If the text of RETURN_FAIL is found in the HTTP response of the gateway privacyIDEA assumes that the SMS could not be sent and an error occurred.

**PROXY**

You can specify a proxy to connect to the HTTP gateway.

**PARAMETER**

This can contain a dictionary of arbitrary fixed additional parameters. Usually this would also contain an ID or a password to identify you as a sender.

###### 4.4.3.3.3.1. Example:

In case of the Clicaktell provider the configuration will look like this:

```

{ "URL" : "http://api.clickatell.com/http/sendmsg",

 "PARAMETER" : {

 "user":"YOU",

 "password":"YOUR PASSWORD",

 "api_id":"YOUR API ID"

 },

 "SMS_TEXT_KEY":"text",

 "SMS_PHONENUMBER_KEY":"to",

 "HTTP_Method":"GET",

 "RETURN_SUCCESS" : "ID"

}

```

This will consturct an HTTP GET request like this:

```

http://api.clickatell.com/http/sendmsg?user=YOU&password=YOU&\

 api_id=YOUR API ID&text=....&to=....

```

where text and to will contain the OTP value and the mobile phone number. privacyIDEA will assume a successful sent SMS if the response contains the text “ID”.

##### 4.4.3.3.4. Sipgate provider

The sipgate provider connects to https://samurai.sipgate.net/RPC2 and takes only two arguments USERNAME and PASSWORD. The arguments have to be passed in a dictionary like this:

```

{ "USERNAME" : "youruser",

 "PASSWORD" : "yourpassword" }

```

> Note:
> 
> You need to use double quotes around the values.

If you activate debug log level you will see the submitted SMS and the response content from the Sipgate gateway.

##### 4.4.3.3.5. SMTP provider

The SMTP provider sends an email to an email gateway. This is a specified, fixed mail address.

The mail should contain the phone number and the OTP value. The email gateway will send the OTP via SMS to the given phone number.

Up to version 2.9 the SMTP provider needs to be configured like this:

```

{"MAILSERVER": "localhost:25",

 "MAILTO": "recp@example.com",

 "MAILSENDER": "pi@example.com",

 "MAILUSER": "username",

 "MAILPASSWORD": "sosecret"}

```

Optional parameters are MAILUSER and MAILPASSWORD if the mailserver to send the email needs authentication.

This configuration is DEPRECATED.

Starting with privacyIDEA 2.10 you can use the system wide SMTP server configuration. The configuration looks like this:

```

{"MAILTO": "recp@example.com",

 "IDENTIFIER": "name-of-smtp-config"}

```

The default SUBJECT is set to <phone> and the default BODY to <otp>. You may change the SUBJECT and the BODY accordingly.
