Email Token configuration

The Email OTP token creates a OTP value and sends this OTP value to the email address of the uses. The Email can be triggered by authenticating with only the OTP PIN:

##### 4.4.3.1.1. First step

In the first step the user will enter his OTP PIN and the sending of the Email is triggered. The user is denied the access.

##### 4.4.3.1.2. Seconds step

In the second step the user authenticates with the OTP PIN and the OTP value he received via Email. The user is granted access.

Alternatively the user can authenticate with the transaction_id that was sent to him in the response during the first step and only the OTP value. The transaction_id assures that the user already presented the first factor (OTP PIN) successfully.

##### 4.4.3.1.3. Configuration Parameters

You can configure the mail parameters for the Email Token centrally at Config -> Tokens -> Email.
