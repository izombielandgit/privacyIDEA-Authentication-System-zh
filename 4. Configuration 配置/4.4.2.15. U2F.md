#### 4.4.2.15. U2F

Starting with version 2.7 privacyIDEA supports U2F tokens. The administrator or the user himself can register a U2F device and use this U2F token to login to the privacyIDEA web UI or to authenticate at applications.

When enrolling the token a key pair is generated and the public key is sent to privacyIDEA. During this process the user needs to prove that he is present by either pressing the button (Yubikey) or by replugging the device (Plug-up token).

The device is identified and assigned to the user.

> Note:
> 
> This is a normal token object which can also be reassigned to another user.
> 
> Note:
> 
> As the key pair is only generated virtually, you can register one physical device for several users.

For configuring privacyIDEA for the use of U2F token, please see U2F Token Config.

For further details and for information how to add this to your application you can see the code documentation at U2F Token.
