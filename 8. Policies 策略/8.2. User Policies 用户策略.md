## 8.2. User Policies

In the Web UI users can manage their own tokens. User can login to the Web UI with the username of their useridresolver. I.e. if a user is found in an LDAP resolver pointing to Active Directory the user needs to login with his domain password.

User policies are used to define, which actions users are allowed to perform.

The user policies also respect the client input, where you can enter a list of IP addresses and subnets (like 10.2.0.0/16).

Using the client parameter you can allow different actions in if the user either logs in from the internal network or remotely from the internet via the firewall.

Technically user policies control the use of the REST API Token endpoints and are checked using Policy Module and Policy Decorators.

> Note:
> 
> If no user policy is defined, the user has all actions available to him, to manage his tokens.

The following actions are available in the scope user:

### 8.2.1. enroll

type: bool

There are enroll actions per token type. Thus you can create policies that allow the user to enroll SMS tokens but not to enroll HMAC tokens.

### 8.2.2. assgin

type: bool

The user is allowed to assgin an existing token, that is located in his realm and that does not belong to any other user, by entering the serial number.

### 8.2.3. disable

type: bool

The user is allowed to disable his own tokens. Disabled tokens can not be used to authenticate.

### 8.2.4. enable

type: bool

The user is allowed to enable his own tokens.

### 8.2.5. delete

type: bool

The user is allowed to delete his own tokens from the database. Those tokens can not be recovered. Anyway, the audit log concerning these tokens remains.

### 8.2.6. unassign

type: bool

The user is allowed to drop his ownership of the token. The token does not belong to any user anymore and can be reassigned.

### 8.2.7. resync

type: bool

The user is allowed to resynchronize the token if it has got out of synchronization.

### 8.2.8. reset

type: bool

The user is allowed to reset the failcounter of the token.

### 8.2.9. setpin

type: bool

The user ist allowed to set the OTP PIN for his tokens.

### 8.2.10. enrollpin

type: bool

If the action enrollpin is defined, the user can set a token PIN during enrollment. If the action is not defined and the user tries to set a PIN during enrollment, this PIN is deleted from the request.

### 8.2.11. otp_pin_maxlength

type: integer

range: 0 - 31

This is the maximum allowed PIN length the user is allowed to use when setting the OTP PIN.

### 8.2.12. otp_pin_minlength

type: integer

range: 0 - 31

This is the minimum required PIN the user must use when setting the OTP PIN.

### 8.2.13. otp_pin_contents

type: string

contents: cns

This defines what characters an OTP PIN should contain when the user sets it.

**c** are letters matching [a-zA-Z].

**n** are digits matching [0-9].

**s** are special characters matching [.:,;-_<>+*!/()=?$ยง%&#~^].

Example: The policy action otp_pin_contents=cn, otp_pin_minlength=8 would require the user to choose OTP PINs that consist of letters and digits which have a minimum length of 8.

cn

test1234 and test12\$\$ would be valid OTP PINs. testABCD would not be a valid OTP PIN.

The logic of the otp_pin_contents can be enhanced and reversed using the characters + and -.

-cn would still mean, that the OTP PIN needs to contain letters and digits and it must not contain any other characters.

-cn (substraction)

test1234 would be a valid OTP PIN, but test12\$\$ and testABCS would not be valid OTP PINs. The later since it does not contain digits, the first (test12\$\$) since it does contain a special character ($), which it should not.

+cn (grouping)

combines the two required groups. I.e. the OTP PIN should contain characters from the sum of the two groups. test1234, test12\$\$, test and 1234 would all be valid OTP PINs.

**(TODO)** grouping and substraction are not implemented, yet.

> Note:
> 
> You can change these character definitions in the privacyidea.ini file using privacyideaPolicy.pin_c, privacyideaPolicy.pin_n and privacyideaPolicy.pin_s. **(Not migrated, yet)**

### 8.2.14. auditlog

type: bool

This action allows the user to view and search the audit log for actions with his own tokens.

### 8.2.15. updateuser

type: bool

If the updateuser action is defined, the user is allowed to change his attributes in the user store.

> Note:
> 
> To be able to edit the attributes, the resolver must be defined as editable.

### 8.2.16. revoke

type: bool

Tokens can be revoked. Usually this means the token is disabled and locked. A locked token can not be modified anymore. It can only be deleted.

Certain token types like certificate may define special actions when revoking a token.

### 8.2.17. password_reset

type: bool

Introduced in version 2.10.

If the user is located in an editable user store, this policy can define, if the user is allowed to perform a password reset. During the password reset an email with a link to reset the password is sent to the user.
