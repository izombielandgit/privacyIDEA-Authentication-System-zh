## 8.3. Authentication policies|认证策略

The scope authentication gives you more detailed possibilities to authenticate the user or to define what happens during authentication.

认证作用域为您提供了更详细的可能性来认证用户或定义认证过程中的情况。

Technically the authentication policies apply to the REST API Validate endpoints and are checked using Policy Module and Policy Decorators.

技术上，认证策略适用于REST API Validate endpoints，并使用Policy Module和Policy Decorators进行检查。

The following actions are available in the scope authentication:

认证作用域中可以使用以下操作：

### 8.3.1. otppin

type: string(类型：字符串)

This action defines how the fixed password part during authentication should be validated. Each token has its own OTP PIN, but you can choose how the authentication should be processed:

此操作定义认证期间验证固定密码部分的方式。每个令牌都有自己的OTP PIN，但您可以选择认证如何处理：

otppin=tokenpin

This is the default behaviour. The user needs to pass the OTP PIN concatenated with the OTP value.

这是默认行为。用户需要通过OTP PIN加上OTP值来认证。

otppin=userstore

The user needs to pass the user store password concatenated with the OTP value. It does not matter if the OTP PIN is set or not. If the user is located in an Active Directory the user needs to pass his domain password together with the OTP value.

用户需要通过用户源密码加上OTP值来认证。无论是否设置了OTP PIN。如果用户位于Active Directory中，则用户需要通过域密码加上OTP值来认证。

> Note:
> 
> The domain password is checked with an LDAP bind right at the moment of authentication. So if the user is locked or the password was changed authentication will fail.
> 
> 注：
> 
> 在认证时使用LDAP绑定权限检查域密码。因此，如果用户被锁定或密码被更改，认证将失败。

otppin=none

The user does not have to pass any fixed password. Authentication is only done via the OTP value.

用户不用输任何固定密码。仅通过OTP值进行认证。

### 8.3.2. passthru

type: str(类型：字符串)

If the user has no token assigned, he will be authenticated against the userstore or against the given RADIUS configuration. I.e. the user needs to provide the LDAP- or SQL-password or valid credentials for the RADIUS server.

如果用户没有分配令牌，他将依靠用户源或给定的RADIUS配置进行认证。也就是说，用户需要为RADIUS服务器提供LDAP或SQL密码或有效凭据。

> Note:
> 
> This is a good way to do a smooth enrollment. Users having a token enrolled will have to use the token, users not having a token, yet, will be able to authenticate with their domain password.  It is also a way to do smooth migrations from other OTP systems.
> 
> 注：
> 
> 这是一个顺畅注册的好方法。拥有已注册令牌的用户必须使用令牌，但没有令牌的用户仍然可以使用其域密码进行身份验证。这也是从其他OTP系统平稳迁移的一种方法。
> 
> The authentication request of users without a token is forwarded to the specified RADIUS server.
> 
> 没有令牌的用户的认证请求被转发到指定的RADIUS服务器。
> 
> Warning:
> 
> If the user has the right to delete his tokens in selfservice portal, the user could delete all his tokens and then authenticate with his static password again.
> 
> 警告：
> 
> 如果用户有在自助服务门户中删除自己令牌的权限，则用户可以删除所有自己的令牌，然后再次用其静态密码进行认证。

### 8.3.3. passOnNoToken

type: bool(类型：布尔型)

If the user has no token assigned, an authentication request for this user will always be true.

如果用户没有分配令牌，则对此用户的认证请求将始终为true。

> Warning:
> 
> Only use this if you know exactly what you are doing.
> 
> 警告：
> 
> 只有当你知道你在做什么时才使用它。

### 8.3.4. passOnNoUser

type: bool(类型：布尔型)

If the user does not exist, the authentication request is successful.

如果用户不存在，则认证请求成功。

> Warning:
> 
> Only use this if you know exactly what you are doing.
> 
> 警告：
> 
> 只有当你知道你在做什么时才使用它。

### 8.3.5. smstext

type: string(类型：字符串)

This is the text that is sent via SMS to the user trying to authenticate with an SMS token. You can use the tags `<otp>` and `<serial>`.

Default: `<otp>`

这是通过SMS发送给尝试使用SMS令牌验证的用户的文本。您可以使用`<otp>`和`<serial>`标签。默认值：`<otp>`

### 8.3.6. smsautosend

type: bool(类型：布尔型)

A new OTP value will be sent via SMS if the user authenticated successfully with his SMS token. Thus the user does not have to trigger a new SMS when he wants to login again.

如果用户使用其SMS令牌成功认证，则将通过SMS发送新的OTP值。因此，当他想再次登录时，用户不必触发新的SMS。

### 8.3.7. emailtext

type: string(类型：字符串)

This is the text that is sent via Email to be used with Email Token. This text should contain the OTP value. You can use the tags <otp> and <serial>.

Default: <otp>

### 8.3.8. emailsubject

type: string(类型：字符串)

This is the subject of the Email sent by the Email Token. You can use the tags <otp> and <serial>.

Default: Your OTP

### 8.3.9. emailautosend

type: bool(类型：布尔型)

If set, a new OTP Email will be sent, when successfully authenticated with an Email Token.

### 8.3.10. mangle

type: string(类型：字符串)

The mangle policy can mangle the authentication request data before they are processed. I.e. the parameters user, pass and realm can be modified prior to authentication.

This is useful if either information needs to be stripped or added to such a parameter. To accomplish that, the mangle policy can do a regular expression search and replace using the keyword user, pass (password) and realm.

A valid action could look like this:

```
action: mangle=user/.*(.{4})/user\\1/
```

This would modify a username like “userwithalongname” to “username”, since it would use the last four characters of the given username (“name”) and prepend the fixed string “user”.

This way you can add, remove or modify the contents of the three parameters. For more information on the regular expressions see <span id="id1">[[1]](#pythonre)</span>.

> Note:
> 
> You must escape the backslash as \\ to refer to the found substrings.

**Example:** A policy to remove whitespace characters from the realm name would look like this:

```
action: mangle=realm/\\s//
```

**Example:** If you want to authenticate the user only by the OTP value, no matter what OTP PIN he enters, a policy might look like this:

```
action: mangle=pass/.*(.{6})/\\1/
```

**Example:** If you want to strip a string from the front of a username, for example to have “admin_username” resolve to just “username”, it would look like this:

```
action: mangle=user/admin_(.*)/\\1/
```

### 8.3.11. challenge_response

type: string(类型：字符串)

This is a list of token types for which challenge response can be used during authentication. The list is separated by whitespaces like “hotp totp”.

> Note:
> 
> The TiQR token does not need this setting, since it always works with challenge response.

### 8.3.12. u2f_facets

type: string(类型：字符串)

This is a white space separated list of domain names, that are trusted to also use a U2F device that was registered with privacyIDEA.

You need to specify a list of FQDNs without the https scheme like:

“host1.example.com host2.exmaple.com firewall.example.com”

For more information on configuring U2F see U2F Token Config.

> [[1]](#id1): https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html<span id="pythonre"></span>

### 8.3.13. reset_all_user_tokens

type: bool(类型：布尔型)

If a user authenticates successfully all failcounter of all of his tokens will be reset. This can be important, if using empty PINs or otppin=None.
