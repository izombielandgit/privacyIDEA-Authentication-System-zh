## 8.3. Authentication policies|认证策略

The scope authentication gives you more detailed possibilities to authenticate the user or to define what happens during authentication.

Technically the authentication policies apply to the REST API Validate endpoints and are checked using Policy Module and Policy Decorators.

The following actions are available in the scope authentication:

### 8.3.1. otppin

type: string

This action defines how the fixed password part during authentication should be validated. Each token has its own OTP PIN, but you can choose how the authentication should be processed:

otppin=tokenpin

This is the default behaviour. The user needs to pass the OTP PIN concatenated with the OTP value.

otppin=userstore

The user needs to pass the user store password concatenated with the OTP value. It does not matter if the OTP PIN is set or not. If the user is located in an Active Directory the user needs to pass his domain password together with the OTP value.

> Note:
> 
> The domain password is checked with an LDAP bind right at the moment of authentication. So if the user is locked or the password was changed authentication will fail.

otppin=none

The user does not have to pass any fixed password. Authentication is only done via the OTP value.

### 8.3.2. passthru

type: str

If the user has no token assigned, he will be authenticated against the userstore or against the given RADIUS configuration. I.e. the user needs to provide the LDAP- or SQL-password or valid credentials for the RADIUS server.

> Note:
> 
> This is a good way to do a smooth enrollment. Users having a token enrolled will have to use the token, users not having a token, yet, will be able to authenticate with their domain password.  It is also a way to do smooth migrations from other OTP systems.
> 
> The authentication request of users without a token is forwarded to the specified RADIUS server.
> 
> Warning:
> 
> If the user has the right to delete his tokens in selfservice portal, the user could delete all his tokens and then authenticate with his static password again.

### 8.3.3. passOnNoToken

type: bool

If the user has no token assigned an authentication request for this user will always be true.

> Warning:
> 
> Only use this if you know exactly what you are doing.

### 8.3.4. passOnNoUser

type: bool

If the user does not exist, the authentication request is successful.

> Warning:
> 
> Only use this if you know exactly what you are doing.

### 8.3.5. smstext

type: string

This is the text that is sent via SMS to the user trying to authenticate with an SMS token. You can use the tags <otp> and <serial>.

Default: <otp>

### 8.3.6. smsautosend

type: bool

A new OTP value will be sent via SMS if the user authenticated successfully with his SMS token. Thus the user does not have to trigger a new SMS when he wants to login again.

### 8.3.7. emailtext

type: string

This is the text that is sent via Email to be used with Email Token. This text should contain the OTP value. You can use the tags <otp> and <serial>.

Default: <otp>

### 8.3.8. emailsubject

type: string

This is the subject of the Email sent by the Email Token. You can use the tags <otp> and <serial>.

Default: Your OTP

### 8.3.9. emailautosend

type: bool

If set, a new OTP Email will be sent, when successfully authenticated with an Email Token.

### 8.3.10. mangle

type: string

The mangle policy can mangle the authentication request data before they are processed. I.e. the parameters user, pass and realm can be modified prior to authentication.

This is useful if either information needs to be stripped or added to such a parameter. To accomplish that, the mangle policy can do a regular expression search and replace using the keyword user, pass (password) and realm.

A valid action could look like this:

```
action: mangle=user/.*(.{4})/user\\1/
```

This would modify a username like “userwithalongname” to “username”, since it would use the last four characters of the given username (“name”) and prepend the fixed string “user”.

This way you can add, remove or modify the contents of the three parameters. For more information on the regular expressions see <span id="id1">[[1]](#pythonre)</span>.

> Note:
> 
> You must escape the backslash as \\ to refer to the found substrings.

**Example:** A policy to remove whitespace characters from the realm name would look like this:

```
action: mangle=realm/\\s//
```

**Example:** If you want to authenticate the user only by the OTP value, no matter what OTP PIN he enters, a policy might look like this:

```
action: mangle=pass/.*(.{6})/\\1/
```

**Example:** If you want to strip a string from the front of a username, for example to have “admin_username” resolve to just “username”, it would look like this:

```
action: mangle=user/admin_(.*)/\\1/
```

### 8.3.11. challenge_response

type: string

This is a list of token types for which challenge response can be used during authentication. The list is separated by whitespaces like “hotp totp”.

> Note:
> 
> The TiQR token does not need this setting, since it always works with challenge response.

### 8.3.12. u2f_facets

type: string

This is a white space separated list of domain names, that are trusted to also use a U2F device that was registered with privacyIDEA.

You need to specify a list of FQDNs without the https scheme like:

“host1.example.com host2.exmaple.com firewall.example.com”

For more information on configuring U2F see U2F Token Config.

### 8.3.13. reset_all_user_tokens

type: bool

If a user authenticates successfully all failcounter of all of his tokens will be reset. This can be important, if using empty PINs or otppin=None.
