# 8. Policies|策略

Policies can be used to define the reaction and behaviour of the system.

Each policy defines the behaviour in a certain area, called scope. privacyIDEA knows the scopes:

* 8.1. Admin policies
* 8.2. User Policies
* 8.3. Authentication policies
* 8.4. Authorization policies
* 8.5. Enrollment policies
* 8.6. WebUI Policies
* 8.7. Audit policies
* 8.8. Gettoken policies
* 8.9. Register Policy

You can define as many policies as you wish to. The logic of the policies in the scopes is additive.

Policy Definition

Starting with privacyIDEA 2.5 you can use policy templates to ease the setup.

* 8.10. Policy Templates

Each policy can contain the following attributes:

**policy name**

A unique name of the policy. The name is the identifier of the policy. If you create a new policy with the same name, the policy is overwritten.

**scope**

The scope of the policy as described above.

**action**

This is the important part of the policy. Each scope provides its own set of actions. An action describes that something is allowed or that some behaviour is configured. A policy can contain several actions. Actions can be of type boolean, string or integer. Boolean actions are enabled by just adding this action - like scope=user:action=disable, which allows the user to disable his own tokens. string and integer actions require an additional value - like scope=authentication:action='otppin=userstore'.

**user**

This is the user, for whom this policy is valid. Depending on the scope the user is either an administrator or a normal authenticating user.

If this field is left blank, this policy is valid for all users.

**resolver**

This policy will be valid for all users in this resolver.

If this field is left blank, this policy is valid for all resolvers.

**realm**

This is the realm, for which this policy is valid.

If this field is left blank, this policy is valid for all realms.

**client**

This is the requesting client, for which this action is valid. I.e. you can define different policies if the user access is allowed to manage his tokens from different IP addresses like the internal network or remotely via the firewall.

You can enter several IP addresses or subnets divided by comma (like 10.2.0.0/16, 192.168.0.1).

**time**

(added in privacyIDEA 2.12)

In the time field of a policy you can define a list of time ranges. A time range can consist of day of weeks (dow) and of times in 24h format. Possible values are:

<dow>: <hh>-<hh> <dow>: <hh:mm>-<hh:mm> <dow>-<dow>: <hh:mm>-<hh:mm>

You may use any combination of these. Like:

Mon-Fri: 8-18

to define certain policies to be active throughout working hours.

> Note:

> If the time of a policy does not match, the policy is not found. Thus you can get effects you did not plan. So think at least twice before using time restricted policies.

Example:
