## 8.1. Admin policies|管理员策略

Admin policies are used to regulate the actions that administrators are allowed to do. Technically admin policies control the use of the REST API Token endpoints, System endpoints, Realm endpoints and Resolver endpoints.

Admin policies are implemented as decorators in Policy Module and Policy Decorators.

The user in the admin policies refers to the name of the administrator.

Starting with privacyIDEA 2.4 admin policies can also store a field “admin realm”. This is used, if you define realms to be superuser realms. See The Config File for information how to do this.

This way it is easy to define administrative rights for big groups of administrative users like help desk users in the IT department.

Admin scope provides and additional field ‘admin realm’.

All administrative actions also refer to the defined user realm. Meaning an administrator may have many rights in one user realm and only a few rights in another realm.

Creating a policy with scope:admin, admin-realm:helpdesk, user:frank, action:enable and realm:sales means that the administrator frank in the admin-realm helpdesk is allowed to enable tokens in the user-realm sales.

> Note:
> 
> As long as no admin policy is defined all administrators are allowed to do everything.

The following actions are available in the scope admin:

### 8.1.1. init

type: bool

There are init actions per token type. Thus you can create policy that allow an administrator to enroll SMS tokens but not to enroll HMAC tokens.

### 8.1.2. enable

type: bool

The enable action allows the administrator to activate disabled tokens.

### 8.1.3. disable

type: bool

Tokens can be enabled and disabled. Disabled tokens can not be used to authenticate. The disable action allows the administrator to disable tokens.

### 8.1.4. revoke

type: bool

Tokens can be revoked. Usually this means the token is disabled and locked. A locked token can not be modified anymore. It can only be deleted.

Certain token types like certificate may define special actions when revoking a token.

###　8.1.5. set

type: bool

Tokens can have additional token information, which can be viewed in the Token Details.

If the set action is defined, the administrator allowed to set those token information.

###　8.1.6. setpin

type: bool

If the setpin action is defined, the administrator is allowed to set the OTP PIN of a token.

###　8.1.7. enrollpin

type: bool

If the action enrollpin is defined, the administrator can set a token PIN during enrollment. If the action is not defined and the administrator tries to set a PIN during enrollment, this PIN is deleted from the request.

###　8.1.8. resync

type: bool

If the resync action is defined, the administrator is allowed to resynchronize a token.

###　8.1.9. assign

type: bool

If the assign action is defined, the administrator is allowed to assign a token to a user. This is used for assigning an existing token to a user but also to enroll a new token to a user.

Without this action, the administrator can not create a connection (assignment) between a user and a token.

###　8.1.10. unassign

type: bool

If the unassign action is defined, the administrator is allowed to unassign tokens from a user. I.e. the administrator can remove the link between the token and the user. The token still continues to exist in the system.

###　8.1.11. import

type: bool

If the import action is defined, the administrator is allowed to import token seeds from a token file, thus creating many new token objects in the systems database.

###　8.1.12. remove

type: bool

If the remove action is defined, the administrator is allowed to delete a token from the system.

> Note:
> 
> If a token is removed, it can not be recovered.
> 
> Note:
> 
> All audit entries of this token still exist in the audit log.

### 8.1.13. userlist

type: bool

If the userlist action is defined, the administrator is allowed to view the user list in a realm. An administrator might not be allowed to list the users, if he should only work with tokens, but not see all users at once.

> Note:
> 
> If an administrator has any right in a realm, the administrator is also allowed to view the token list.

### 8.1.14. checkstatus

type: bool

If the checkstatus action is defined, the administrator is allowed to check the status of open challenge requests.

### 8.1.15. manageToken

type: bool

If the manageToken action is defined, the administrator is allowed to manage the realms of a token.

A token may be located in multiple realms. This can be interesting if you have a pool of spare tokens and several realms but want to make the spare tokens available to several realm administrators. (Administrators, who have only rights in one realm)

Then all administrators can see these tokens and assign the tokens. But as soon as the token is assigned to a user in one realm, the administrator of another realm can not manage the token anymore.

### 8.1.16. getserial

type: bool

If the getserial action is defined, the administrator is allowed to calculate the token serial number for a given OTP value.

### 8.1.17. getrandom

type: bool

The getrandom action allows the administrator to retrieve random keys from the endpoint getrandom. This is an endpoint in System endpoints.

getrandom can be used by the client, if the client has no reliable random number generator. Creating API keys for the Yubico Validation Protocol uses this endpoint.

### 8.1.18. getchallenges

type: bool

This policy allows the administrator to retrieve a list of active challenges of a challenge response tokens. The administrator can view these challenges in the web UI.

### 8.1.19. losttoken

type: bool

If the losttoken action is defined, the administrator is allowed to perform the lost token process.

To only perform the lost token process the actions copytokenuser and copytokenpin are not necessary!

### 8.1.20. adduser

type: bool

If the adduser action is defined, the administrator is allowed to add users to a user store.

> Note:
> 
> The user store still must be defined as editable, otherwise no users can be added, edited or deleted.

### 8.1.21. updateuser

type: bool

If the updateuser action is defined, the administrator is allowed to edit users in the user store.

### 8.1.22. deleteuser

type: bool

If the deleteuser action is defined, the administrator is allowed to delete an existing user from the user store.

### 8.1.23. copytokenuser

type: bool

If the copytokenuser action is defined, the administrator is allowed to copy the user assignment of one token to another.

This functionality is also used during the lost token process. But you only need to define this action, if the administrator should be able to perform this task manually.

### 8.1.24. copytokenpin

type: bool

If the copytokenpin action is defined, the administrator is allowed to copy the OTP PIN from one token to another without knowing the PIN.

This functionality is also used during the lost token process. But you only need to define this action, if the administrator should be able to perform this task manually.

### 8.1.25. smtpserver_write

type: bool

To be able to define new SMTP server configuration or delete existing ones, the administrator needs this rights smtpserver_write.

### 8.1.26. eventhandling_write

type: bool

Allow the adminstrator to configure Event Handler.
