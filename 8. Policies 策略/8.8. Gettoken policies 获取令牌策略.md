## 8.8. Gettoken policies|获取令牌策略

The scope gettoken defines the maximum number of OTP values that may be retrieved from an OTP token by an administrator.

The user attribute may hold a list of administrators.

Technically the gettoken policies control the use of the gettoken_controller.

The following actions are available in the scope gettoken:

### 8.8.1. max_count_dpw

type: int

This is the maximum number of OTP values that are allowed to be retrieved from a DPW token.

> Note:
> 
> Issuing only one OTP value per day, this means that this is the number of days, this OTP list can be used.

### 8.8.2. max_count_hotp

type: int

This is the maximum number of OTP values that are allowed to be retrieved from an HOTP (HMAC) token.

> Note:
> 
> As hotp values only expire, when they are used, you can use this to create an OTP list, that can be used from the first to the last OTP value.

### 8.8.3. max_count_totp

type: int

This is the maximum number of OTP balues that are allowed to be retrieved from a TOTP token.

> Note:
> 
> As the default TOTP token generates a new OTP value all 30 seconds, retrieving 100 OTP values will only give you OTP values, that are usable for 50 minutes.
