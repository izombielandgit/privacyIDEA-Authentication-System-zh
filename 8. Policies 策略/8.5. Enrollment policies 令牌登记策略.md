## 8.5. Enrollment policies|令牌登记策略

The scope enrollment defines what happens during enrollment either by an administrator or during the user self enrollment.

Enrollment policies take the realms, the client (see Policies) and the user settings into account.

Technically enrollment policies control the use of the REST API Token endpoints and specially the init and assign-methods.

Technically the decorators in API Policies are used.

The following actions are available in the scope enrollment:

### 8.5.1. max_token_per_realm

type: int

This is the maximum allowed number of tokens in the specified realm.

> Note:
> 
> If you have several realms with realm admins and you imported a pool of hardware tokens you can thus limit the consumed hardware tokens per realm.

### 8.5.2. max_token_per_user

type: int

Limit the maximum number of tokens per user in this realm.

> Note:
> 
> If you do not set this action, a user may have unlimited tokens assigned.

### 8.5.3. tokenissuer

type: string

This sets the issuer label for a newly enrolled Google Authenticator. This policy takes a fixed string, to add additional information about the issuer of the soft token.

> Note:
> 
> A good idea is to set this to the instance name of your privacyIDEA installation.

### 8.5.4. tokenlabel

type: string

This sets the label for a newly enrolled Google Authenticator. Possible tags to be replaces are \<u\> for user, \<r\> for realm an \<s\> for the serial number.

The default behaviour is to use the serial number.

> Note:
> 
> This is useful to identify the token in the Authenticator App.
> 
> Warning:
> 
> If you are only using <u> as tokenlabel and you enroll the token without a user, this will result in an invalid QR code, since it will have an empty label. You should rather use a label like “user: <u>”, which would result in “user: ”.

### 8.5.5. autoassignment

type: string

allowed values: any_pin, userstore

Users can assign a token just by using this token. The user can take a token from a pool of unassigned tokens. When this policy is set, and the user has no token assigned, autoassignment will be done: The user authenticates with a new PIN or his userstore password and an OTP value from the token. If the OTP value is correct the token gets assigned to the user and the given PIN is set as the OTP PIN.

> Note:
> 
> Requirements are:
> 
> 1. The user must have no other tokens assigned.
> 2. The token must be not assigned to any user.
> 3. The token must be located in the realm of the authenticating user.
> 4. (The user needs to enter the correct userstore password)
> 
> Warning:
> 
> If you set the policy to any_pin the token will be assigned to the user no matter what pin he enters. In this case assigning the token is only a one-factor-authentication: the possession of the token.

### 8.5.6. otp_pin_random

type: int

Generates a random OTP PIN of the given length during enrollment. Thus the user is forced to set a certain OTP PIN.

> Note:
> 
> To use the random PIN, you also need to define a pinhandling policy.

### 8.5.7. pinhandling

type: string

If the otp_pin_random policy is defined, you can use this policy to define, what should happen with the random pin. The action value take the class of a PinHandler like privacyidea.lib.pinhandling.base.PinHandler. The base PinHandler just logs the PIN to the log file. You can add classes to send the PIN via EMail or print it in a letter.

For more information see the base class PinHandler.

### 8.5.8. change_pin_on_first_use

type: bool

If the administrator enrolls a token or resets a PIN of a token, then the PIN of this token is marked to be changed on the first (or next) use. When the user authenticates with the old PIN, the user is authenticated successfully. But the detail-response contains the keys “next_pin_change” and “pin_change”. If “pin_change” is True the authenticating application must trigger the change of the PIN using the API /token/setpin. See Token endpoints.

> Note:
> 
> If the application does not honour the “pin_change” attribute, then the user can still authenticate with his old PIN.

### 8.5.9. change_pin_every

type: string

This policy requires the user to change the PIN of his token on a regular basis. Enter a value follewed by “d”, e.g. change the PIN every 180 days will be “180d”.

The date, when the PIN needs to be changed, is returned in the API response of /validate/check. For more information see change_pin_on_first_use. To specifiy the contents of the PIN see User Policies.

### 8.5.10. otp_pin_encrypt

type: bool

If set the OTP PIN of a token will be encrypted. The default behaviour is to hash the OTP PIN, which is safer.

### 8.5.11. lostTokenPWLen

type: int

This is the length of the generated password for the lost token process.

### 8.5.12. lostTokenPWContents

type: string

This is the contents that a generated password for the lost token process should have. You can use

* **c**: for lowercase letters
* **n**: for digits
* **s**: for special characters (!#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_)
* **C**: for uppercase letters

**Example:**

The action lostTokenPWLen=10, lostTokenPWContents=Cns could generate a password like AC#!49MK)).

### 8.5.13. lostTokenValid

type: int

This is how many days the replacement token for the lost token should be valid. After this many days the replacement can not be used anymore.

### 8.5.14. yubikey_access_code

type: string

This is a 12 character long access code in hex format to be used to initialize yubikeys. If no access code is set, yubikeys can be re-initialized by everybody. You can choose a company wide access code, so that Yubikeys can only be re-initialized by your own system.

You can add two access codes separated by a colon to change from one access code to the other.
