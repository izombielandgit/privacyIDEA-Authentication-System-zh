##8.9. Register Policy|注册策略

### 8.9.1. User registration

Starting with privacyIDEA 2.10 users are allowed to register with privacyIDEA. I.e. a user that does not exist in a given realm and resolver can create a new account.

> Note:
> 
> Registering new users is only possible, if there is a writeable resolver and if the necessary policy in the scope register is defined. For editable UserIdResolvers see UserIdResolvers.

If a register policy is defined, the login window of the Web UI gets a new link “Register”.

![register](../Contents/register.png)

Next to the login button is a new link ‘register’, so that new users are able to register.

A user who clicks the link to register a new account gets this registration dialog:

![register-dialog](../Contents/register-dialog.png)

Registration form

During registration the user is also enrolled Registration token. This registration code is sent to the user via a notification email.

> Note:
> 
> Thus - using the right policies in scope webui and authentication - the user could login with the password he set during registration an the registration code he received via email.

### 8.9.2. Policy settings

In the scope register several settings define the behaviour of the registration process.

Creating a new registration policy

#### 8.9.2.1. realm

type: string

This is the realm, in which a new user will be registered. If this realm is not specified, the user will be registered in the default realm.

#### 8.9.2.2. resolver

type: string

This is the resolver, in which the new user will be registered. If this resolver is not specified, registration is not possible!

> Note:
> 
> This resolver must be an editable resolver, otherwise the user can not be created in this resolver.

#### 8.9.2.3. smtpconfig

type: string

This is the unique identifier of the SMTP server configuration. This SMTP server is used to send the notification email with the registration code during the registration process.

> Note:
> 
> If there is no smtpconfig or set to a wrong identifier, the user will get no notification email.

#### 8.9.2.4. requiredemail

type: string

This is a regular expression according to <span id="id1">[[1]](#pythonre)</span>.

Only email addresses matching this regular expression are allowed to register.

Example: If you want to authenticate the user only by the OTP value, no matter what OTP PIN he enters, a policy might look like this:

```
action: requiredemail=/.*@mydomain\..*/
```

This will allow all email addresses from the domains mydomain.com, mydomain.net etc...
