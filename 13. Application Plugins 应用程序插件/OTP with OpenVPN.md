## OTP with OpenVPN

This section describes, how you can setup OpenVPN to authenticate against privacyIDEA. There are basically three ways to integrate OpenVPN with privacyIDEA:

1. use the privacyidea_pam.py module for PAM
2. integrate OpenVPN directly with RADIUS
3. use the PAM module for RADIUS in OpenVPN

Each of the methods has its andvantages as well as drawbacks.

On the client side, you need to add:

```
auth-user-pass
```

to the client configuration.

Now the user is asked for a password when establishing the VPN connection. The entered password is sent to privacyIDEA. Thus you can require the user to enter a password consisting of a static part he knows and the OTP part which the user needs to generate with the OTP token he possesses.

Another addition you most probably want to make is adding the following option to both the client and the server configuration:

```
reneg-sec 0
```

By default, the channel key gets renegotiated after 3600 seconds, either partner can request a renegotiation. If only one partner disables this option, the other one will request it. This works fine for static password or dual-factor authentication where both factors are static (e.g. password and certificate/smartcard).

When using OTP authentication, note that this default value may cause the end user to be challenged to reauthorize once per hour. The OpenVPN client with the option –auth-user-pass prompts for username and password for every renegotiation.

Network-Manager does not rechallenge the user and the VPN connection hangs, so you’ll need to disabled the renegotiation.

If you are also requiring client certificates, the user needs

1. a machine certificate
2. a password
3. and an OTP token

to establish a VPN connection.

### privacyidea_pam.py module for OpenVPN

For this the PAM stack is used. To get the basic information about integrating privacyIDEA with PAM, read Pluggable Authentication Module. Since we do not use RADIUS this is the least complex configuration and for most installations probably the preferred one. The biggest drawback is that you need to install the privacyidea-pam package on your OpenVPN server. As long as the package is not part of your distribution you need to handle updates/security fixes manually or by using the packages provided by privacyIDEA.

You can create a file /etc/pam.d/openvpn on your OpenVPN server that basically looks like this:

```
auth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_python.so
    /path/to/privacyidea_pam.py url=https://your.privacyidea.server
auth    requisite           pam_deny.so
auth    required            pam_permit.so
session sufficient          pam_permit.so
account sufficient          pam_permit.so
```

Then you need to configure the OpenVPN server like this:

```
port 1194
[...]
plugin /usr/lib/openvpn/openvpn-auth-pam.so openvpn
```

The important line is the last line, which tells OpenVPN to use the PAM stack to authenticate the user and within the PAM stack the configuration for “openvpn”. On certain distributions the library might be located at /usr/lib64/openvpn/plugin/lib/openvpn-auth-pam.so.

### Integration of OpenVPN directly with RADIUS

This configuration does not use PAM, so might be preferred in some installations. You will need the package openvpn-auth-radius which should be part of your distribution. Before you can configure your OpenVPN you need to install freeradius on your privacyIDEA server and configure it according to FreeRADIUS Plugin. Be sure that RADIUS works before you start.

Copy the file /usr/share/doc/openvpn-auth-radius/examples/radiusplugn.cnf into /etc/openvpn and adapt it to your configuration. The most important parts of the file should contain:

```
# The NAS identifier which is sent to the RADIUS server
NAS-Identifier=OpenVPN
OpenVPNConfig=/etc/openvpn/server.conf
[...]
server
{
      # The UDP port for radius accounting.
      acctport=1813
      # The UDP port for radius authentication.
      authport=1812
      # The name or ip address of the radius server.
      name=<your-radius-server>
      # How many times should the plugin send the if there is no response?
      retry=1
      # How long should the plugin wait for a response?
      wait=1
      # The shared secret.
      sharedsecret=<shared-secret>
}
```

After the changes restart your OpenVPN service and keep a look at the logs of OpenVPN on your access server as well as the freeradius logs on your RADIUS server.

If you use privacyidea-radius 2.6 or earlier, you make sure you have the following entry in /etc/freeradius/sites-enabled/privacyidea:

```
[...]
accounting {
      detail
}
[...]
```

Otherwise RADIUS will authenticate your user, but refuse to add the accounting data that the OpenVPN plugin sends and the connect will fail.

### Using the PAM module for RADIUS in OpenVPN

The other method to integrate OpenVPN with RADIUS (and privacyIDEA) is to use the PAM module libpam-radius-auth. If you have other services running on your OpenVPN server that should integrate into privacyIDEA as well, this might be your preferred method.

You can create a file /etc/pam.d/openvpn on your OpenVPN server that basically looks like this:

```
auth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_radius_auth.so
auth    requisite           pam_deny.so
auth    required            pam_permit.so
session sufficient          pam_permit.so
account sufficient          pam_permit.so
```

Then you need to configure the OpenVPN server like this:

```
port 1194
[...]
plugin /usr/lib/openvpn/openvpn-auth-pam.so openvpn
```

Now we need to tell the PAM plugin which RADIUS server to use. Modify the file /etc/pam_radius_auth.conf to point to your RADIUS server and add the shared secret:

```
# server[:port] shared_secret      timeout (s)
#127.0.0.1      secret             1
#other-server    other-secret       3
<your-radius-server>:1812 <shared-secret> 3
```

Now you can restart your OpenVPN service and should be able to connect with your PIN and OTP. Again, have a look at the logs of both OpenVPN and RADIUS.
