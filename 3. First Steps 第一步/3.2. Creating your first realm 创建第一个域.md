Users in privacyIDEA are read from existing sources. See Realms for more information.

In these first steps we will simply read the users from your /etc/passwd file.

### 3.2.1 Create a UserIdResolver

The UserIdResolver is the connector to the user source. For more information see UserIdResolvers.

* Go to Config -> Users to create a UserIdResolver.

  ![resolver1](../Contents/resolver1.png)

  Create the first UserIdResolver

* Choose New passwdresolver and
* Enter the name “myusers”.
* Save it.

  ![resolver2](../Contents/resolver2.png)

  Create the first UserIdResolver

You just created your first connection to a user source.

### 3.2.2. Create a Realm

User sources are grouped togeather to a so called “realm”. For more information see Realms.

* Go to Config -> Realms
* Enter “realm1” as the new realm name and select the priority 1.
* Check the resolver “myusers” to be included into this realm.
* Save it.

  ![realm1](../Contents/realm1.png)

  Create the first Realm

* Go to Users and you will see the users from the /etc/passwd.

![users](../Contents/users.png)

  The users from /etc/passwd

**Congratulation!**You created your first realm.

You are now ready to enroll a token to a user. Read Enrolling your first token.
