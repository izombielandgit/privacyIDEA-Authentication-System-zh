## 3.1. Login to the Web UI|登录Web界面

privacyIDEA has only one login form that is used by administrators and normal users to login. Administrators will be able to configure the system and to manage all tokens, while normal users will only be able to manage their own tokens.

You should enter your username with the right realm. You need to append the realm to the username like username@realm.

### 3.1.1. Login for administrators

Administrators can authenticate at this login form to access the management UI.

Administrators are stored in the database table Admin and can be managed with the tool:

```
pi-manage admin ...
```
The administrator just logs in with his username.

> Note:
> 
> You can configure privacyIDEA to authenticate administrators against privacyIDEA itself, so that administrators need to login with a second factor. See SUPERUSER_REALM in inifile_superusers how to do this.

### 3.1.2. Login for normal users

Normal users authenticate at the login form to be able to manage their own tokens. By default users need to authenticate with the password from their user source.

E.g. if the users are located in an LDAP or Active Directory the user needs to authenticate with his LDAP/AD password.

But before a user can login, the administrator needs to configure realms, which is described in the next step Creating your first realm.

> The administrator may change this behaviour by creating an according policy, which then requires the user to authenticate against privacyIDEA itself. I.e. this way the user needs to authenticate with a second factor/token to access the self service portal. (see the policy section login_mode)
